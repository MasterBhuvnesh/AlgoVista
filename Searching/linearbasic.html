      <h1>Basics of Linear Searching</h1>

      

      <h2>Introduction to Linear Search</h2>
      <p>Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that operates on both sorted and unsorted data. It is based on a sequential checking approach, where each element in a data structure (such as an array or list) is examined one by one until the desired value is found or the end of the structure is reached.</p>

      <p>In linear search, the search begins at the first element and proceeds towards the last, comparing each element with the target value. If a match is found, the index of that element is returned. If no match is found, the algorithm concludes that the target is not present.</p>
      <p>Linear search does not require any specific data order and is particularly useful for small or unsorted datasets where more complex algorithms may not be efficient or applicable.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3><b>Sequential Search Principle in Linear Search</b></h3>
      <p>Linear search follows a sequential checking principle, where each element in a data structure is checked one after another in a linear fashion. Think of flipping through the pages of a book to find a specific word: you start from the first page and check each page sequentially until the word is found or you reach the end of the book. This method is simple and works on both unsorted and small datasets but may be inefficient for larger collections.</p>

      <br>


      

      <br><br>

      <h3><b>Types of Linear Search:</b></h3>
      <li><b>Simple Linear Search:</b>In a simple linear search, the algorithm checks each element of the data structure sequentially from the beginning to the end. This is the most basic and straightforward version of linear search, applicable to both sorted and unsorted datasets. It is often used for small collections where efficiency is not a concern.</li>
      <li><b>Sentinel Linear Search:</b>In a sentinel linear search, a sentinel element is placed at the end of the data structure to simplify the code by eliminating the need to check for the end of the list within the loop. This reduces the number of comparisons slightly but otherwise operates similarly to the simple linear search, scanning each element until the target is found.

      </li>

      <br>

      <h3><b>Basic Operations on Linear Search:</b></h3>

      <li><b>search():</b>This is the main operation in linear search, where the algorithm sequentially checks each element in a list or array to find the target value. If the target is found, the index of the element is returned; otherwise, it returns a signal (e.g., -1 or None) indicating that the element is not present.</li>
      <li><b>isFound():</b>This operation checks whether the target value is found in the list during the search. It returns true if the target is found and false if the search reaches the end of the data without finding the target.</li>
