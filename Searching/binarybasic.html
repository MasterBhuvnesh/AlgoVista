      <h1>Basics of Linear Searching</h1>

      

      <h2>Introduction to Binary Search</h2>
      <p>Binary search is a highly efficient search algorithm that operates on sorted data structures. It is based on the divide-and-conquer principle, where the search space is repeatedly divided into halves. The target value is compared with the middle element of the data structure, and based on the result, the search continues in either the left or right half of the remaining data.</p>

      <p>For binary search to work, the data must be sorted. The algorithm begins by comparing the middle element with the target. If the target is smaller than the middle element, the search is confined to the left half; if larger, the search continues in the right half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the search space is reduced to zero.</p>
      <p>Binary search is significantly more efficient than linear search for large, sorted datasets, as it reduces the search space by half in each step, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n). However, it is not suitable for unsorted data without prior sorting.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h3><b>
        Divide and Conquer Principle in Binary Search</b></h3>
      <p>Binary search operates on the divide and conquer principle, where the search space is continuously divided into halves. Imagine searching for a word in a dictionary: instead of checking each word sequentially, you open the dictionary to a page near the middle, compare the word you are looking for with the middle word, and then decide to look either in the first or second half of the dictionary. By repeating this process, you quickly narrow down the search space. This makes binary search highly efficient for large, sorted datasets.</p>

      <br>

    

      <br><br>

      <h3><b>Types of Binary search :</b></h3>
      <li><b>Iterative Binary Search:</b>In an iterative binary search, the algorithm divides the search space into halves using a loop. The middle element of the array or list is compared with the target value, and the search continues in either the left or right half based on the comparison. This method is preferred when recursion should be avoided, as it uses fewer resources in terms of memory.</li>
      <li><b>Recursive Binary Search:</b>A recursive binary search follows the same process as the iterative version but uses recursive function calls instead of loops. The function is called repeatedly, each time narrowing the search to one half of the array. This method is more elegant and concise but may use more memory due to recursive function calls, making it less efficient in some cases.</li>

      <br>

      <h3><b>Basic Operations in Binary Search</b></h3>

      <li><b>search():</b>The search operation divides the sorted data structure into two halves. It compares the target value with the middle element and narrows the search to the left or right half based on the comparison. This process repeats until the target value is found or the search space becomes empty.</li>
      <li><b>findMid():</b>This operation calculates the middle index of the current search space. The middle element is crucial in binary search, as it determines whether the search will proceed to the left or right half.</li>
      <li><b>isFound():</b>This operation checks whether the target value is found during the binary search. It returns true if the target is located and false if the search space is exhausted without finding the target.</li>
      <li><b>isSorted():</b>Binary search requires the data to be sorted. This operation checks whether the input list or array is sorted before the binary search is initiated. If the data is unsorted, binary search cannot proceed.</li>
