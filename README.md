## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start with Fundamentals**
   - Choose a topic from the main dashboard
   - Read the theory and objectives

2. **Take the Pre-Test**
   - Assess your current knowledge
   - Identify areas for improvement

3. **Learn with Visuals**
   - Explore interactive graphical representations
   - Understand algorithm step-by-step execution

4. **Practice Implementation**
   - Study code examples
   - Understand time and space complexity

5. **Validate Learning**
   - Take the post-test to measure progress
   - Compare with pre-test results

## 🧪 Quiz System

- **Pre-Tests:** Evaluate existing knowledge before learning
- **Post-Tests:** Assess understanding after completing the topic
- **Randomized Questions:** 5 questions selected randomly from a larger pool
- **Instant Feedback:** Immediate results with correct/incorrect highlighting
- **Retry Option:** Multiple attempts to improve scores

## 🎨 Visual Features
