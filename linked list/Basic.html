      <h2>Introduction to Linked List</h2>
      <p>
        A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of
        nodes connected by pointers or references. Each node contains data and a
        pointer/reference to the next node in the list. The fundamental
        components of a LLinked list are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Node:</strong> For storing the data.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pointer Node:</strong>This will Points to next Data node.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It
        mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to
        arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures
        like stack, queue and deque.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Linked List</h2>
      <h3 style="font-weight: 800">Singly linked List</h3>
      <p>
        The node contains a pointer to the next node means that the node stores
        the address of the next node in the sequence. A single linked list
        allows the traversal of data only in one way. Here are some of the key
        applications of singly linked lists:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Implementing Stacks and Queues:</strong> Singly linked lists
          can be used to efficiently implement both stack and queue data
          structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Navigation in Web Browsers:</strong> Singly linked lists can
          be used to store the browsing history in web browsers, allowing users
          to navigate back and forth through visited web pages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 style="font-weight: 800">Doubly Linked List</h3>
      <p>
        A doubly linked list or a two-way linked list is a more complex type of
        linked list that contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous
        node in sequence. Doubly Linked List are commonly used in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Navigation Systems:</strong> Doubly linked lists are useful in
          navigation systems where forward and backward navigation is required.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Game Development:</strong> Doubly linked lists can be used in
          games, such as a deck of cards, where the ability to move forwards and
          backwards through the data is important.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 style="font-weight: 800">Circular Linked List</h3>
      <p>
        A circular linked list is that in which the last node contains the
        pointer to the first node of the list. Circular Linked List are commonly
        used in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Process queues:</strong> Circular linked lists can be used to
          maintain a queue of processes, where each process gets a turn in a
          cyclic order.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scheduling and managing playlists:</strong>Circular linked
          lists are especially helpful for tasks like scheduling and managing
          playlists, allowing for seamless navigation through the list.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 style="font-weight: 800">Circular Doubly Linked List</h3>
      <p>
        A circular doubly linked list is defined as a circular linked list in
        which each node has two links connecting it to the previous node and the
        next node. Circular doubly Linked List are commonly used in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data manipulation:</strong>Circular doubly linked lists allow
          for movement in both directions, which can increase flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repetitive tasks:</strong>The circular structure of the list
          makes it a natural fit for repetitive tasks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advantages of Linked Lists</h2>
      <ul style="list-style: circle">
        <li>
          Linked Lists are mostly used because of their effective insertion and
          deletion. We only need to change few pointers (or references) to
          insert (or delete) an item in the middle
        </li>
        <li>
          Insertion and deletion at any point in a linked list take O(1) time.
          Whereas in an array data structure, insertion / deletion in the middle
          takes O(n) time
        </li>
        <li>
          This data structure is simple and can be also used to implement a
          stack, queues, and other abstract data structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementation of Queue and Deque data structures : Simple array
          implementation is not efficient at all. We must use circular array to
          efficiently implement which is complex. But with linked list, it is
          easy and straightforward. That is why most of the language libraries
          use Linked List internally to implement these data structures..
        </li>
        <li>
          Linked List might turn out to be more space efficient compare to
          arrays in cases where we cannot guess the number of elements in
          advance. In case of arrays, the whole memory for items is allocated
          together. Even with dynamic sized arrays like vector in C++ or list in
          Python or ArrayList in Java. the internal working involves
          de-allocation of whole memory and allocation of a bigger chunk when
          insertions happen beyond the current capacity.
        </li>
      </ul>
