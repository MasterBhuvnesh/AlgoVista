      <h2>Introduction to Graphs</h2>
      <p>
        A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes)
        and edges. The fundamental components of a graph are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vertex (Node):</strong> A point or object in the graph.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge:</strong> A connection between two vertices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Graphs are non-linear because they allow multiple paths between
        vertices, unlike linear data structures such as arrays or linked lists.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
      <h3>Directed Graphs (Digraphs)</h3>
      <p>
        In a directed graph, each edge has a direction, going from one vertex to
        another. This direction is typically represented by an arrow. Directed
        graphs are used in scenarios such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Task Scheduling:</strong> Tasks are vertices, and dependencies
          are directed edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Web Page Link Analysis:</strong> Web pages are vertices, and
          hyperlinks are directed edges.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Undirected Graphs</h3>
      <p>
        In an undirected graph, edges have no direction. The connection between
        two vertices is bidirectional. Undirected graphs are commonly used in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Social Networks:</strong> Relationships between individuals
          are bidirectional.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network Topologies:</strong> Computer networks where
          connections are mutual.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Graph Terminology</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Path:</strong> A sequence of edges connecting a series of
          vertices. For example, in a graph representing a city map, a path
          could represent a route from one location to another.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loop:</strong> An edge that connects a vertex to itself. In a
          network, this might represent a feedback loop or self-referencing
          connection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Degree:</strong> The number of edges incident to a vertex. In
          social networks, the degree of a vertex could represent the number of
          friends an individual has.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cycle:</strong> A path that starts and ends at the same vertex
          without repeating any edge. In logistics, cycles might represent
          routes that return to the starting point.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connected Graph:</strong> A graph where there is a path
          between any pair of vertices. Useful in scenarios like ensuring all
          nodes in a network are reachable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complete Graph:</strong> A graph in which every pair of
          distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. This is used in
          scenarios requiring maximum connectivity, like communication networks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> A graph where edges have weights
          representing values such as distance or cost. Used in routing
          problems, like finding the shortest path in a map.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simple Graph:</strong> A graph without loops or multiple edges
          between the same pair of vertices. Simple graphs are often used in
          theoretical studies and algorithms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Graph Representations</h2>
      <p>
        Graphs can be represented in various ways, each with its own advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong> A 2D array where each cell at index
          (i, j) represents the presence or weight of an edge from vertex i to
          vertex j.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjacency List:</strong> An array where each vertex points to
          a list of adjacent vertices. This representation is more
          space-efficient for sparse graphs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this tutorial, we'll use the Adjacency Matrix representation for
        simplicity and broad applicability. You'll learn how to implement it on
        the next page.
